# The Endorphin Engine

The goal of the Endorphin Engine is to create a model for game character interaction where the characters' actions are determined in whole or in part by their ideal cocktail of endorphins and current endorphin levels. Combined with a character relationship model based on Markov chains, the Endorphin Engine can add greater replayability to otherwise deterministic games.

## Types of Endorphins

The Engine uses the following endorphins to define character motivation:

* Dopamine - keeps a stressed body feeling good, a precursor to adrenaline and noradrenaline.
* Adrenaline - gives the character bursts of energy, minimizes bleeding, dilates air passages.
* Noradrenaline - provides focus.
* Seratonin - combats depression. Excesses cause hallucination.
* Melatonin - helps sleep, released by darkness, increased by light. Also combats depression.
* Anandamide - causes bliss, loss of short-term memory. Sedative, calming, fertility.
