# The Endorphin Engine

The goal of the Endorphin Engine is to create a model for game character interaction where the characters' actions are determined in whole or in part by their ideal cocktail of endorphins and current endorphin levels. Combined with a character relationship model based on Markov chains, the Endorphin Engine can add greater replayability to otherwise deterministic games.
